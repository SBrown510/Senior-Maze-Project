Randomization:
	For this project I used Rand to randomize the weights within my program. I seeded it to 100
	which depending on the scenario could give me equal weights in different edges but that doesn't
	hurt my program. Using this method I was able to create two graph objects instead of work with just
	one graph because when you see Rand, the values that are given are the same so the graphs have the same
	values but are different objects to interact with.

Extra tests:

	I was curious of how my base program ran so I added in a couple tests:
	
		Horizantal and Vertical ladder: to Run call ./a.out 10 10
		This show the basic functionality of my program, the program sets
		all edge weights to 1 and you will see what I call the horizantol and vertical ladders
		of the base case of my program.
