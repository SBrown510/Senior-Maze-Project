# Senior-Maze-Project
This is a maze project that creates a maze of variable size greater then 10 using 1's as walls and 0's as paths and solves these mazes using prims and Djikstras algorithm.

To run this you can compile all the files with g++ and using command
 g++ main.cpp mazeGraph.cpp edge.cpp heaptree.cpp

and then running it using the size you'd like.
./a.out [width] [height]

For example 
./a.out 70 20
